                        Dollar?</h3>
                    <p class="fxs-content-module-content">Monetary policy in the US is shaped by the Federal Reserve
                        (Fed). The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its
                        primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates.<br>When prices are rising
                        too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing
                        borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes
                        the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money.<br>When
                        inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates
                        to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.</p>

                    <h3 class="fxs-content-module-header">How often does the Fed hold monetary policy meetings?</h3>
                    <p class="fxs-content-module-content">The Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year,
                        where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary
                        policy decisions.<br>The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the
                        Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the
                        remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.

                    <h3 class="fxs-content-module-header">What is Quantitative Easing (QE) and how does it impact USD?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="fxs-content-module-content">In extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a
                        policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially
                        increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system.<br>It is a non-standard policy measure
                        used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed’s weapon of choice during
                        the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to
                        buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.</p>

                    <h3 class="fxs-content-module-header">What is Quantitative Tightening (QT) and how does it impact
                        the US Dollar?</h3>
                    <p class="fxs-content-module-content">Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE,
                        whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest
                        the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive
                        for the value of the US Dollar.</p>
