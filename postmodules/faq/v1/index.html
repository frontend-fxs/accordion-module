                            The Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world
                            (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is
                            the fourth most traded unit for foreign exchange (FX) in the
                            world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging $630
                            billion a day, according to 2022 data.<br />Its key trading
                            pairs are GBP/USD, aka 'Cable', which accounts for 11% of FX,
                            GBP/JPY, or the 'Dragon' as it is known by traders (3%), and
                            EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of
                            England (BoE).

                            How do the decisions of the Bank of England impact on the Pound
                            Sterling?
                        </h3>
                        <p class="fxs-content-module-content">
                            The single most important factor influencing the value of the
                            Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of
                            England. The BoE bases its decisions on whether it has achieved
                            its primary goal of "price stability" â€“ a steady inflation rate
                            of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the
                            adjustment of interest rates.<br />When inflation is too high,
                            the BoE will try to rein it in by raising interest rates, making
                            it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit.
                            This is generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates
                            make the UK a more attractive place for global investors to park
                            their money.<br />When inflation falls too low it is a sign
                            economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will
                            consider lowering interest rates to cheapen credit so businesses
                            will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.

                            How does economic data influence the value of the Pound?

                        <p class="fxs-content-module-content">
                            Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact the
                            value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP,
                            Manufacturing and Services PMIs, and employment can all
                            influence the direction of the GBP.<br />A strong economy is
                            good for Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign
                            investment but it may encourage the BoE to put up interest
                            rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if
                            economic data is weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall.

                            How does the Trade Balance impact the Pound?

                            Another significant data release for the Pound Sterling is the
                            Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between
                            what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on
                            imports over a given period.<br />If a country produces highly
                            sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the
                            extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase
                            these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens
                            a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.
