                        <p class="fxs-faq-module-content"> The Pound Sterling (GBP) is the oldest currency in the world
                            (886 AD) and the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is the fourth most traded unit
                            for foreign exchange (FX) in the world, accounting for 12% of all transactions, averaging
                            $630 billion a day, according to 2022 data.<br />Its key trading pairs are GBP/USD, aka
                            'Cable', which accounts for 11% of FX, GBP/JPY, or the 'Dragon' as it is known by traders
                            (3%), and EUR/GBP (2%). The Pound Sterling is issued by the Bank of England (BoE). </p>

                        <p class="fxs-faq-module-content"> The single most important factor influencing the value of the
                            Pound Sterling is monetary policy decided by the Bank of England. The BoE bases its
                            decisions on whether it has achieved its primary goal of "price stability" â€“ a steady
                            inflation rate of around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is the adjustment of
                            interest rates.<br />When inflation is too high, the BoE will try to rein it in by raising
                            interest rates, making it more expensive for people and businesses to access credit. This is
                            generally positive for GBP, as higher interest rates make the UK a more attractive place for
                            global investors to park their money.<br />When inflation falls too low it is a sign
                            economic growth is slowing. In this scenario, the BoE will consider lowering interest rates
                            to cheapen credit so businesses will borrow more to invest in growth-generating projects.

                        <p class="fxs-faq-module-content"> Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact
                            the value of the Pound Sterling. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs,
                            and employment can all influence the direction of the GBP.<br />A strong economy is good for
                            Sterling. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the BoE to
                            put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen GBP. Otherwise, if economic data is
                            weak, the Pound Sterling is likely to fall. </p>

                        </h3>
                        <p class="fxs-faq-module-content"> Another significant data release for the Pound Sterling is
                            the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from
                            its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period.<br />If a country produces
                            highly sought-after exports, its currency will benefit purely from the extra demand created
                            from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance
                            strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance. </p>
